# Advanced RAG Testing Document

## Hybrid Search Requirements

This document contains test content for validating hybrid search functionality in the AI Assistant system.

### Requirements for Hybrid Search Testing

1. **Semantic Search**: The system must perform semantic similarity matching using vector embeddings
2. **Keyword Search**: The system must perform traditional keyword-based text matching
3. **Combined Results**: Hybrid search combines both semantic and keyword results for optimal relevance

### Performance Benchmarks

The system must meet the following performance benchmarks:

- **Response Time**: < 10 seconds for 95% of queries
- **Availability**: > 99.9% uptime with fallback models
- **Accuracy**: User satisfaction scores by model type
- **Cost Efficiency**: Cost per successful query by complexity

### Quality Validation Criteria

Quality validation includes the following metrics:

1. **Quality Score**: Overall response quality (0.0 to 1.0)
2. **Completeness Score**: How complete the answer is
3. **Reliability Score**: Confidence in source accuracy
4. **Coherence Score**: How well the response flows

### Confidence Thresholds

- **Minimum Confidence Threshold**: 0.5 for source filtering
- **High Confidence**: > 0.8 for premium sources
- **Medium Confidence**: 0.5 - 0.8 for standard sources
- **Low Confidence**: < 0.5 sources are filtered out

### Testing Scenarios

1. **Simple Queries**: Basic factual questions
2. **Moderate Queries**: Technical questions requiring context
3. **Complex Queries**: Multi-part analysis requiring deep reasoning

This document serves as test content for validating the advanced RAG configuration and ensuring proper hybrid search functionality.
