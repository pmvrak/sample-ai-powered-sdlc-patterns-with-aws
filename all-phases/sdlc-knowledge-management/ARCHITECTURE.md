## Architecture Decisions & Rationale

### Technology Choices

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | React + TypeScript + Vite | Modern development experience, type safety, fast builds |
| **CDN** | CloudFront | Global edge locations, origin access control, cost-effective |
| **API** | API Gateway REST | Managed service, built-in throttling, CORS support |
| **Authentication** | Cognito User Pools | Managed OAuth 2.0, JWT tokens, MFA support |
| **Compute** | Lambda Functions | Serverless, auto-scaling, pay-per-use pricing |
| **AI/ML** | Amazon Bedrock | Managed AI service, Claude Sonnet 4, no infrastructure |
| **Vector Search** | OpenSearch Serverless | Managed vector database, automatic scaling |
| **Document Storage** | S3 | Unlimited storage, versioning, lifecycle policies |
| **Metadata Storage** | DynamoDB | NoSQL, single-digit millisecond latency, auto-scaling |
| **Monitoring** | CloudWatch | Native AWS integration, custom metrics, alerting |

### Design Patterns

#### 1. Microservices Architecture
- **6 specialized Lambda functions** for different responsibilities
- **Single responsibility principle** - each function has one clear purpose
- **Loose coupling** - functions communicate via API Gateway and shared storage
- **Independent deployment** - each function can be updated independently

#### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
- **S3 event triggers** for automatic Knowledge Base synchronization
- **CloudWatch Events** for scheduled monitoring tasks
- **API Gateway integration** for synchronous request/response patterns
- **Asynchronous processing** for document upload and processing

#### 3. Security by Design
- **Defense in depth** - multiple security layers
- **Least privilege access** - IAM roles with minimal permissions
- **Encryption everywhere** - data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Zero trust model** - every request authenticated and authorized

#### 4. Observability First
- **Structured logging** - JSON logs with correlation IDs
- **Custom metrics** - business and technical metrics in CloudWatch
- **Distributed tracing** - request tracking across services
- **Proactive monitoring** - alarms and automated responses
